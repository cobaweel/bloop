\section{Declarations}
 The C declaration syntax is one REALLY big ball of hair. It is
 virtually impossible to come up with an AST that captures all legal C
 declarations, but nothing else, and is still reasonably
 concise. 

 Instead, I will provide a *subset* of the C language, which does not
 include some gratuitous abbreviations. A parser could expand those
 abbreviations on the fly, and anything that targets C automatically
 probably doesn't use them. It also does not include many "K$\&$R"
 misfeatures absent or deprecated in ANSI.

 Examples of abbreviations not supported are:

\begin{verbatim}
 int x, y;    => int x; int y;
 int x, *x;   => int x; int* x;
\end{verbatim}

 This greatly simplifies the abstract grammar. It does make it
 impossible to parse a C file and pretty-print the exact same thing
 back out; rather, a small bit of preprocessing becomes irreversible.

The pretty-printing of expressions is somewhat conservative. It tries
to omit the most superfluous parentheses, but still inserts more than
are strictly necessary. Trying to emulate a human C programmer in this
regard would be tricky; most programmer's rely on some, but not all,
of the precedence rules.
